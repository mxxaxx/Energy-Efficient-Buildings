                Construction Methods and why they work
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Chimneys</b><br>
                One way of improving the energy efficiency of homes is to construct chimneys inside the houses.<br>
                This means that thermal energy can be transferred into the bedrooms upstairs instead of outside. This is useful energy.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Walls</b><br>
                The rate at which energy is transferred through walls of a house depends on four things:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The temperature difference between inside and outside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The area of the walls. The larger the walls the harder they are to heat, as more thermal energy is required to heat by one degree Celsius.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The thermal conductivity of the walls. Some materials are conductors, others are insulators. The higher the thermal conductivity of a material, the higher the rate of energy transfer by conduction across the material.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the thickness of walls/windows is important. The thicker the walls, the slower the rate of energy loss.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Modern houses use two layers of brick to ensure they have thicker walls. This increases efficiency because the energy has to travel longer distances to get out of the house.<br>
                The house has cavity wall insulation between the layers of brick. The foam is trapped foal of air.<br>
                Because air is a good insulator, it helps keep the house warm by trapping the energy inside the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Loft insulation and carpets</b><br>
                One quarter of an uninsulated properties energy is lost through the roof. This is because of the convection process, which causes hot air to move up.<br>
                If the loft is insulated it stays warm. Carpets do the opposite they insulate from the floor. These aren't as important for the fact outlined before.<br>
                However  can still be a valuable addition to the building. This is because an estimated 10% of energy is lost through uninsulated flooring. Carpets can<br>
                result in this being lessened. This benefit is doubled when there is a harsh winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Double Glazing</b><br>
                <img src="http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/graphics/diagrams/heat/double-glazing.gif" class="img" alt="Image that shows how double glazing works" longdesc="http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/graphics/diagrams/heat/double-glazing.gif"><br>
                As can be seen in the image above double glazing utilises the properties of air to ensure that the thermal insulation is far better than before.<br>
                This works wonders and can save a lot of energy. It also has many other useful properties that are oustide the scope of this Homework.<br>
                Double Glazing reduces heat loss by a staggering <b>54% to 64%</b>.<br>

                Cooling Effects<br>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Implementation of Techniques mentioned beforehand</b><br>
                If the techniques mentinoed beforehand are implemented a lot can happen. I will go into further depth on the economic benefits as well as the environmental benefits<br>
                in the next sub-section. Here I will focus on the implementation of these techniques. Some problems with the implementation of these techniques include that they<br>
                often have to be built in whilst the house is being build. For example thick walls essentially require a whole new build. The same goes for insulating materials as the walls.<br>
                However some do not require a whole rebuilding of housing. They only require a renovation. These are affordable for upper middle class. But if someone is renovating<br>
                they often do not prioritize these aspects of housing because they are misinformed. They prioritize the things they actually feel on a daily basis e.g. showers.<br>
                The easiest technique to implement is adding carpets. Whilst not all carpets are equally effective, there is not a substantial difference between most.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Environmental Benefits</b><br>
                Being more energy efficient is incredibly invaluable. When someone is energy efficient many problems get solved. This is trivial to understand but I will<br>
                explain it anyways. The key problem with climate change is that we are using too much energy. If we used less fossil fuels we might be able to reach<br>
                a balance that is sustainable, this is sadly not possible currently. If people are more efficient then they are more sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Economic Benefits of the Individual</b><br>
                Energy costs money. If you use less energy you are using less money.<br>
                This means that you end up having more money on things that you actually want to spend it on.<br>
                Carpets shave up to 10% off your energy bill.

                The Physics Behind it all
            </h2>
            <p>
                <b>Why houses are hot at the top</b><br>
                <img src="https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/b/b6/Convection_cell_room_labeled.gif/375px-Convection_cell_room_labeled.gif"><br>
                <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Convection">Image Source</a><br>
                The process above is called convection. Convection is simple once you understand it, but it can be a little peculiar to wrap your head around at first.<br>
                The principle is simple. Hot air goes up. Cool air goes down. The reasoning is a little more complicated<br>
                When air is hot the particles have more energy. They move around more. This means that they end up being more spread out and less dense.<br>
                In cold air, exactly the opposite occurs. The particles have less energy and clump together as if their trying to keep warm.<br>
                Because the cold air is <i>more dense</i> it sinks; the hot air is <i>less dense</i> so it rises. When the hot air reaches the top it loses it's energy<br>
                and sinks again. This is called convection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The magical chain effect of conduction</b><br>
                Conduction is the transfer of energy through a solid. Note, it only works if the solid is a conductor.<br>
                In the side of the solid that has the highest temperature the particles are vibrating the most.<br>
                These particles bump into eachother. This chain reaction ends up making more particles vibrate and eventually the particles in the initially colder side are vibrating<br>

                Wind Turbines
            </h2>
            <p>
                Even though it sounds ridiculous, wind turbines are an effective way of increasing temperature within your homes. If you have a large garden<br>
                they can be extremely profitable. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that 250 pounds can be saved each year if a 6kW wind turbine pole is mounted in your garden<br>
                As wind turbines are renewable, they do not harm the environment very much. 
            </p>

                Air Source heat pumps
            </h2>
            <p>
                If wind turbines are cool. Then I do not possess the vocabulary to explain how incredible air source heat pumps are.<br>
                It uses heat from the <i>outside air</i> to heat up your own home. Yes! This does mean that if you waste some energy<br>
                it gets returned back to your home. I definitely believe these are the future as they can save up to 360 pounds each year compared to an oil based system<br>
                and are much better for our environment.

                Triple Glazing
            </h2>
            <p>
                Triple glazed windows are extremely energy efficient. They work in the same way as double glazed windows but just with one extra layer.<br>
                They also come with the additional effect of reducing noise. However they are still very expensive and therefore not a realistic solution for most people.<br>
